    <p>My favorite course has been Market Design, which teachers how to
    effectively design strategies and rules to create markets that minimize inefficiency
    and the possibility of cheating, all while maximizing stability and rationality. 
    It is the basis of auction theory and hinges upon probability, statistics,
    and logic. It has been effectively used to create the  current U.S. National 
    Residency Match, to determine how to best allocate organs in the kidney exchange
    market, and to match students from New York City to their high schools.
